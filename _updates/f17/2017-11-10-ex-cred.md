To help with office hour wait times, extra credit is being introduced for the
remainder of the semester. If an advanced homework is turned in 2 or more days
prior to the due day (i.e. on Monday or earlier), 2 extra credit points will be
awarded.  If the advanced homework is turned in 1 day early (i.e. on Tuesday), 1
extra credit point will be awarded. This will **not** apply to previous
assignments, only the ones due on 11/15 and onward.
