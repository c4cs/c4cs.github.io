There are two forms you have to complete,
[**one for HR**](https://deptapps.engin.umich.edu/si/ia/index?dept=216000)
so that you're officially considered an applicant in the eyes of the university,
and another [**for us**](https://tinyurl.com/c4cs-ia-form) so those of us on staff
have the opportunity to get to know you as a person :)

If you have any additional questions, our email inboxes are always open at
<c4cs-staff@umich.edu>.
