  This 1-credit seminar is designed to teach the essentials of using a computer
  effectively for EECS students. While the target audience is CS/CE/DS
  students, any student wishing to learn how to use their computer much more
  effectively is encouraged to join. Topics covered include shells,
  environment, scripting, Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools, and version
  control. The last month of the course will be open to student input for
  remaining useful topics to cover.

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown

# This is a bit of a hack, since we're using remark, which expects
# to render markdown itself, we need to prevent jekyll from picking
# it up and parsing it, however we would still like to use the templating
# features of jekyll so that we can just write slides alone, in a
# markdown file. Thus we override the extensions list so that jekyll does
# not treat .markdown files as markdown.
