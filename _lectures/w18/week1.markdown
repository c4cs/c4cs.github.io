# What this class is about

---

# What this class is about

- This is not "Tools for Computer Scientists"

- Though, we will cover a lot of cool tools

- The goal is to give you the ability to pick up, learn, and use tools effectively

- The goal is not to completely teach you any tool (they made the internets for that!)

---

# This class is _NOT_ a set of tutorials

.left-column[
1. Log in to a CAEN machine in Linux
2. Press the "windows" key to open the application launcher and then type "gedit"
3. Now copy-paste the following block of code into the window:
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() { printf("Hello World\n"); return 0; }
    ```
4. Type "Ctrl-s" or click the "save" icon, save the file as "myprogram.c" in your home directory.
5. Press the "windows" key again and type "terminal"
6. In the window that appears, type "gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram"
7. Now type "./myprogram"
]
.right-column[
1. Open your favorite text editor and
write a basic "Hello World" program
2. Compile and run your program
]

# Lectures give you the "what" and the "why", homeworks are a self-guided tour on the "how"

- Lectures are designed to be interactive

- Lots of live coding, lots of mistakes!

- **Bring your laptop to every class**

---

# This is a very individual class

## Nothing in this class is hard...

--

## The second time you do it

# Collaboration

## Less than you're used to

- The goal is to build your _individual_ skills

- You will get the most benefit doing assignments on your own

## "The 15 Minute Rule"

- A little frustration is a good thing, a lot is a bad thing

   * Try to solve a problem on your own for 15 minutes before asking for help
   * After 15 minutes, ask for help!
   * Good rule of thumb outside of this class too

# You need will need your own computer for this class

### CAEN machines are **NOT** sufficient for this class

### If you don't have your own computer...

- Dog ate it
- TSA confiscated it on your flight to Michigan
- Drunk roommate confused it for a frisbee

The CSE department has some loaner laptops available for the semester<sup>&dagger;</sup>

- Contact Don Winsor: <a href="mailto:don@umich.edu">don@umich.edu</a>

# Straw Poll: Who has Linux on their laptop?

--

## Having something Unix-like on your machine will make your CS life at Michigan much more pleasant

- This not because Unix is "better"
- This does not mean you cannot use Windows

--

## This is pretty easy to do with most laptops now

- OS X has it built in
- [Linux subsystem for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/faq) in the "Windows 10 Anniversary Update"

# The C4CS Game!!

--

## Round 1: The Forearm Check

--

## Round 2a: What is a computer, really?

## Round 2b: What makes up a computer?

--

## What is a "Virtual Machine?"

--

### Also a safe playground for you to explore

### Also a common platform for teaching

# &nbsp;

--

## For HW1, you'll install a VM to use this semester

---

# Live exercises in a Unix environment

- What is a shell?

- Why learn this stuff in 2017?

- The critical basics:

   - Where am I?

   - What is nearby?

- What commands have you seen before?
