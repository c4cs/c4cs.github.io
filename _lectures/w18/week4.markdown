# Learning Basic Math

```bash
% echo "#include <iostream>
> using namespace std;
>
> int main() {
>     cout << "2 + 2 = " << 4 << endl;
>
>     return 0;
> } " > math.cpp
```

  - That was cheap!
  - Let's check it out...

# Quick Game: Name an editor

--

 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors

???

"name an editor" ->
  1. Diversity of _types_ of editors (text, image, video, etc)
  2. Drill into text (or code): Plethora of choices exist for a reason

**Why even talk about editors?**

# Editors are the stuff between your head and the screen

  - You can walk and talk
  - You can walk and read
  - Could you walk and code?

--

## Writing code is like writing text, until it isn't

  - Organize an outline
  - Choose a section, author a cohesive narrative
    - How long of a paragraph can you hold in your head?
    - How many lines of code can you hold in your head?

--

## Programmers are translating all the time

  - Between what you want the machine to do (concept/spec) and _how_ you tell the machine to do it (code)

???

Walk and code has some depth:
  - Couldn't walk and write an essay
  - Could walk and dictate an essay
  - WHY?

# Editor Wars: An Educated Guess

  - Programmers fight about silly things
    - Tabs vs Spaces, Where to put Braces
  - That may not be so silly

--

## It is all about what best minimizes the friction between what's in your head and what's on the screen

- People tell me DVORAK is faster than QWERTY<sup>1</sup>, but probably not for me

# Lecture Today

- **The Basics**

  1. Marcus struggles mightily with emacs

  2. And then does great in vim

  3. We cover where the mouse is a winner

  - _Goal:_ Minimal competency in everything, so you can work with others

- **The Fancy Stuff**

  1. In "old" editors

  2. In "new" editors

  3. And what each other can't do

  - _Goal:_ Exposure to the kind of things you can do. What is most useful is very personal.

## A digression: w vs x (vs ZZ)

  - `:w` always writes, `:x` only if changed
    - Why do you care?
    - It's a bit annoying to need to care

# "Enter some text" in vim, oh the many ways

## `i` is the easiest, yet probably least used, way to enter text

  - `i` - Go into insert mode here
  - `I` - Go into insert mode at the beginning of the line
  - `a` - Go into insert mode right after here
  - `A` - Go into insert mode at the end of the line
  - `o` - Insert a new line below and go into insert mode
  - `O` - Insert a new line above and go into insert mode
  - `s` - Delete this character and go into insert mode
  - `S` - Delete this line and go into insert mode
  - `C` - Delete the line from here and go into insert mode
  - `R` - Enter _replace_ mode

# Reviewing some old magic

Remember Homework 2?

```bash
$ wget 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B4qlH840ZwikbkZLS3Z5YTVSeW8&export=download' -O eecs280-w15-p2.tgz
$ tar -xf eecs280-w15-p2.tgz
$ echo -e '#include <cassert>\n#include "p2.h"\n' > p2.cpp
$ grep ';' p2.h | grep -v ' \*' >> p2.cpp

$ vim p2.cpp
# press 'jjj'   so that your cursor is on the i of int sum(...
# press 'qq'    to begin recording a macro into the vim register q
# press 'f;'    jump to the ';' character
# press 's'     remove character under the cursor and enter insert mode
# insert the needed text:
# '<space>{<enter>assert(false);<enter>}<enter><escape>'
# press 'j'     so that your cursor is on the i of int product(...
# press 'q'     to finish recording the macro
# press '16@q'  16 times play the commands stored in register q
```

# "Vim sucks because"...

## it can't copy / paste

  - Yes it can, you just `y`ank and `p`aste instead
  - And to cut you off, you can use `"+y` and `"+p` to yank and paste from the system clipboard

## you can't use the mouse

  - Yes you can, you just have to `set mouse=a`

## the defaults are ~~terrible~~ not great

  - Now you're getting somewhere

## the time and pain required to learn it aren't worth the payoff

  - I am honestly unsure.

# This class in a nutshell:

  - You are willing to type the same command over and over until you aren't
    - So you learn about the up arrow
  - You master the game of up-up-up-enter up-up-up-enter until you drive yourself nuts
    - So you learn how to put these commands in a script
  - _You might be willing to master a new skill faster if you knew it was out there, and someone guided you towards how to do it_

### The goal is to expose you to many things, hope you master half, and can come back and pick up the rest when you're ready

  - We do try to emphasize the ones worth mastering first
  - Like version control. Seriously. Version control. All the things. Always.
