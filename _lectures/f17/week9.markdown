# What Does gdb Do?

## Yes

- Start your program (with options and arguments)
- Stop your program
- Allow you to see into registers and memory
- Allow you to change values manually during execution

--

## No

- **MAGIC**

???

A debugger is a program than runs another program. This lets the debugger
(the parent) stop, start, or modify the program that is being debugged (the
child, target, or inferior).

# How Do I gdb?

To debug a program with gdb, simply put `gdb` in front of the program, i.e.:

--

```bash
> ./prime # running normally
> gdb ./prime # debugging the program with gdb
```

--

One annoying gotcha shows up if the program to debug takes any options. The
simple prime program does not, but if it did:

```bash
> ./prime --imaginary-option # running normally
> gdb ./prime --imaginary-option # will not work
gdb: unrecognized option '--imaginary-option'
> gdb --args ./prime --imaginary-option # gdb will ignore everything after --args
```

# GDB's Text User Interface

  * It's a CLI program, get over it!
  * Nope... Beast Mode... GDB TUI
    * At launch with --tui
    * After launch with `C-x 1`

## GDB TUI Key Bindings (partial)

| Binding   |  Action                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|  `C-x a`  |  Enter/exit TUI                                        |
|  `C-x 1`  |  Change TUI layout?                                    |
|  `C-x 2`  |  Change TUI layout                                     |
|  `C-x o`  |  Switch window focus                                   |
|  `C-x s`  |  Single Key mode                                       |
|  `C-l`    |  Refresh screen                                        |
|  `C-p`, `C-n`, `C-b`, `C-f`  |  Readline navigation (Emacs FTW!)   |

# GDB TUI Single Key Mode

  * This is truly GDB Beast Mode... on steroids!

| Key | Action                   |
| --- | :----------------------- |
| c   | continue                 |
| d   | down                     |
| f   | finish                   |
| n   | next                     |
| q   | exit the Single Key mode |
| r   | run                      |
| s   | step                     |
| u   | up                       |
| v   | info locals              |

# gdb Commands

## `run`

- Starting gdb will not run your program by default. You must use the `run`
  command to begin execution.
- Using `run` will start your program with the options originally specified,
  or you can pass new options with `run`.

```bash
(gdb) run --different-option
```

- If your project is recompiled, each `run` will automatically reload the new
  version. Debugging is easier if you don't quit gdb, but leave it running in
  a separate terminal.


---


# gdb Commands

## `backtrace`, `up`, `down`, `frame`, `print`

- While your program is running, it has a function call stack that is built
  up with frames that hold parameters, locals, and register information for
  each invocation. Consider math.c:

.column-66[
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int subtract (int a, int b) { return a - b; }
int divide (int a, int* b) { return a / *b; }
int do_math (int x, int y, int z) {
    int temp = subtract(x, y);
    temp = divide(z, &temp);
    return temp;
}
int main () {
    int temp;
    temp = do_math(10, 10, 20);
    printf("Result: %d\n", temp);
    return 0;
}
```
]

.column-33[
Function call stack (growing to the right)

main

main -> do_math

main -> do_math -> subtract

main -> do_math

main -> do_math -> divide
]

# gdb Commands

## `list`, `break`, `continue`, `step`, `next`, `set`

- Look at your source with `list` or `list <function>`

--

- Stop and start your program with `break` and `continue`

--

- Take things at your own pace with `step` (into) and `next`

--

- Make a change to variables and registers with `set`


---


# More on breakpoints

- Generally specified by filename:linenumber
- Will also work in context
- List all current breakpoints with `info breakpoints`
- Remove with `delete <number>` or `disable <number>` until later
- Skip over working code with breakpoints on either side and `continue`

# GDB Does Python!!

  * Access to GDB internals
  * Variables, functions, etc.
  * Inline, short entry, and script
  * A pretty printer

```python
class ObjectPrinter:
    '''Pretty print an Object'''

    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val

    def to_string(self):
        '''Change this to reflect real properties from the object'''
        return self.val

    def lookup_type(val):
        if val == 'Object':
            return ObjectPrinter(val)

    def display_hint(self):
        return 'Object'

gdb.pretty_printers.append(lookup_type)
```
