# Q: What is a Build System?

???

 - AKA: Build Automation Software
 - Script/automate compilation

--

# Q: Who has used a one?

???

 - Everyone in 280 and beyond

---

# Make, the Grandbinary of them all

 - Automate compiling and linking
 - Easily repeat long/complex commands
 - Eliminate unnecessary work

???

 - Stuart Feldman, 1976, Bell Labs
 - Replaced shell scripts commonly used

---

# Make syntax
## (in 2 lines or less)

--

```bash
target: dependencies
        rules
```

???

 - target: The thing we're trying to build
 - dependencies: The thing(s) that must come before
 - rules: The steps needed to build target once the dependencies are all here

---

# 3 Makefiles

  1. EECS 280 WN15
  2. Build a sentence
  3. EECS 281 (time permitting)

---

# Let's Makefile!

  - Build a sentence
    - Subject
    - Verb
    - Object
  - "Source" files (.sh) create "Output" files (.txt)
    - Need a source file for each word
    - Need a source file for the whole sentence
  - NEED A MAKEFILE

---

# Other build systems

--

## make-based

- GNU make
- nmake
- ...

--

## Non-make/Proprietary

- Bazel (Google's tool)
- Buck (Facebook's tool)
- MSBuild (Microsoft's tool)
- xcodebuild (Apple's tool)
- ...

--

## Other languages for scripting and building

- Rake (ruby)
- Apache Ant (Java + XML)
- A-A-P (python)
- sbt (Scala)
- ...

---

# Why stop at compilation?

What else could we automate?

--

- Build script generation
- Installation
- Testing
- Continuous Integration (CI)

???

- make-based tools build well and then... bash
- proprietary tools integrate with or control IDEs
- CI tools use build systems, IDE aware, Notifications
