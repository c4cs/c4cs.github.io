`OH++` Editors
==============

## vim vs. emacs vs. everything else

We don't advocate for one editor over another. That may sound contradictory,
given Darden's consistent shoutouts to "Team Vim", but trust me when I say this
is merely tribal, red team / blue team ridiculousness. None of us seriously
believe one editor is strictly better than the other. Everyone thinks
differently. Everyone works differently. Everyone has preferences which
differentiate them from their peers, but it's frequently difficult to argue
that one set of preferences is strictly better than the other. Whatever helps
you think clearly and efficiently puts bytes into files will be the editor you
use.

That said, we _will_ recommend that everyone know how to use at least one
command line editor. It will make your life easier when you find yourself on
a command line without access to a graphical editor. This happens more often
than you might think.

Regretably, I don't have the time (tonight) to write a guide to emacs. That
said, if you come to my office hours wanting to know how to customize emacs,
I will gleefully learn along with you.

## On customization

When you install your first plugin, there can be an urge to go crazy and
immediately install ten more. You may even feel tempted to use a pre-configured
version of vim or emacs, like `spf-13 vim` and `spacemacs`. In general, it's
better to start small and build up your own configuration. The reasoning is
3-fold ...

1. These editors are already confusing enough. Most of the time, these
   'all-in-one' starter packages usually don't make the learning curve any
   easier. These editors already have a ton of features. Double check that you
   can't already do what you want with stock features.
1. By writing your own configuration file and selecting your own plugins,
   you'll be much more familiar with what you've actually installed. It'll be
   much easier to remember the any new commands, features, or hotkeys because
   you'll be setting them up.
1. Part of the advantage to using a [close to] stock editor is being
   comfortable when you don't have access to your own configuration.

That said, plugins can be really helpful, and get you more invested in
professional development leading you to more interesting corners of computing.

___Yes.___

### `vim`

Key points:
* Vim is "Modal" -- it has modes. Insert, Visual, Normal, Replace -- etc.
  - Key combinations can change based on which mode you're in.
* Vim is pretty quick to open.
  - This allows you to open and close files quite quickly to bounce back to the
      command line.
* You may never learn all of the vim hotkeys.
  - And that's totally fine. I just learned how markers work. That's
      not even a vim feature -- it's been around since vi (thirty years?).


#### Installing a plugin

We recommend that you use a plugin manager, but it is important to have an idea
of what's going on. [This brief
post](https://howchoo.com/g/ztmyntqzntm/how-to-install-vim-plugins-without-a-plugin-manager)
gives some intuition for what is happening behind the scenes.

For now, knowing how to use a plugin manager is good enough. Personally,
I use `vim-plug`, but there's `Vundle`, `neobundle`, and `pathogen` which come
to mind as well. There's not a huge difference between them, but I find that
`vim-plug` is the most straightforward.

[Go ahead and install `vim-plug` here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
The guide for installing plugins is pretty comprehensive. Come to office hours
if you still need help.

#### Changing the colorscheme

Vim actually comes with a bunch of colorschemes built in. Go ahead and try
this. After opening vim, type `:colorscheme <tab>`. Go ahead and cycle through.
If you want the change to be permanent , add the command `colorscheme
<colorscheme name>` to your `.vimrc` file and it will be invoked everytime you
start vim.

To install another colorscheme, add the `<colorscheme name>.vim` file to
`~/.vim/colors` folder. Some may require additional setup, like special
terminal integration. Hopefully, we've prepared you well for this. When
installed with a plugin manager, the colorscheme should be accessible as long
as you set it after the section of your `.vimrc` file where the plugins are
declared. This is because custom colorschemes from plugins are not "on the
path" for vim until the plugin manager adds them.

#### Creating a new keybinding

> _"This keybinding makes no sense. How do I change it?"_
> _- everyone at some point_

When writing markdown files, much like this one, I like to be able to use spell
check. Most of the time though, I'll want it off. I always forget the command,
`:setlocal spell!<CR>`, so I set it to `<leader>ss`. Now, when I press `,ss` in
normal mode, spell check underlines incorrectly spelled words.

I enabled this by adding `nmap <leader>ss :setlocal spell!<CR>` to my `.vimrc`
file. Let's break this down.

```
nmap <leader>ss :setlocal spell!<CR>
|    |          \
|    \           This is where you'll put the sequence of keys for the command.
\     The leader key begins many commands. The default is backslash \
 'map' means "Map this key combination to a command", the 'n' in 'nmap' means
 it only applies to normal mode.
```

Whenever you want to change your `.vimrc` file, you've got to open it in some
text editor to make changes. You don't need to leave vim to do this, as you can
always just open the file from within vim, by this will likely require you to
type the full file path. And, once you've finished editing and saved your
`.vimrc`, you'll have to reload the file for any changes to take effect. This
is all super lame, so I've rebound the sequences for these two actions to two,
easy to remember key combinations.

```
" reload vimrc (reload RC)
nmap <leader>rc :so ~/.config/nvim/init.vim<CR>

" Edit ~/.vimrc (Edit Vim Rc)
nmap <leader>erc :e ~/.config/nvim/init.vim<CR>
```

## 'emacs'

Key points:
* Emacs is very command based:
   - Many of the commands you will learn are started with other commands and direct typing of
     commands afterwards (etc M -x ...., C -x ...)
* Emacs has a versatile list of modes:
   - Emacs has a mode for most everything you could want to do, thought it will require some
     research to understand the route you wnat to take getting there
* Emacs has all of its tools built into the editor
   - Editing any of the settings and managing packages and customization is all handled through
     Emacs itself because it has built in GUI's for these aspects of the editor.

# First thing to know

* In order to acces the myriad of commands in Emacs, the notation that begins accessing them begins with either:
  - 'C -...' which is the same as pressing Ctrl with another key (examples like C -a). There is
     also the command 'C -x', which prompts for another command to come afterwards (example C -x
     (C -s).
  --and--
  - 'M -...' which is the same as pressin Alt with a key.  There is also 'M -x' and his key is 
    very important because it prompts the user for command input afterward, in the minibuffer.
  - These commands will appear in the minibuffer at the bottom of the Emacs editor in a small
    window.
  - These tools are essential to operating Emacs as they control the way you interact with the 
    program. For more information on commands in Emacs, it is highly reccomended to check out the 
    wiki to get a better understanding on the depth you can go into. Keep in mind that it is not 
    required to understand every in and out of Emacs to operate it efficiently. (visit https://
    www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryCommands for more)

* Certain customization aspects of Emacs require you to edit the init file in Emacs. This is located in your home directory, usually under the name .emacs. If it is not this look inside your .emacs.d directory (from your home) and try to find .init.el.
.

# Installing packages
* Installing packages is very easy in Emacs as it has a built in GUI just to do so. This is accessed by the command 'M -x list-packages' to open a list of packages in Emacs. You can then scroll through and mark packages for installation with 'i', 'u' to unmark them, and 'x' to perform the installation. You can press 'RET' to get more information on the pacakge you're on too.

* If you want to install an outside package, there are two routes you can go down. You can either:
   - insert code in the init file of emacs in the format of: 
     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
            If you wanted to get to the melpa archives, for example.
   - or you can use the command 'M -x customize-variable' and then type 'package-archives' in
     order to edit archives through a GUI

# Customizing colorscheme
* Emacs already has a list of built in colorschemes you can choose from, simply from going to the GUI menu through the command 'M -x customize-themes', and you can select some of the pre-canned ones listed. 

* Installing custom themes in Emacs requires you to add a directory to the load path of emacs. This is a fairly easy task if you already have access to your .init file (told you it would come in handy):
  - In order to start this process you look online for some custom themes and place them in a 
    directory that you know. A fairly common practice is to place in the ~/.emacs.d/lisp 
    directory, which if it isn't there you can just make.
  - Then, go to your init file and add the following line to the init file:
    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "your-file-path").
  - From there you should be able to see the loaded theme in the GUI list when you run M-x 
    customize-themes
