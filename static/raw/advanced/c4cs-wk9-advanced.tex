\section{``printf debugging''}

While debuggers and memory-checkers and all of the other tools can be very
powerful, sometimes the easiest thing to do is simply print some things out as
your program runs. Commenting and re-enabling lines all the time, however,
gets pretty tedious pretty quickly. Consider something like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
  #include <stdio.h>

  #ifdef NDEBUG
  #define DBG(_s)
  #else
  #define DBG(_s) printf(_s)
  #endif

  int main() {
    DBG("Program starting\n");
    printf("Hello World\n");
  }
\end{lstlisting}

One improvement on this is to distinguish debugging prints. Perhaps by
prefixing them with \texttt{"Debug: "}, like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
  // Careful copying this in, the trailing \'s are important. Macros are by
  // definition one line, but that can be hard to read. A trailing \ (with no
  // whitespace after it!) means to continue as if the next line were part of
  // this line, so this whole thing is "one line":
  #define DBG(_s)\
    do {\
      printf("Debug: ");\
      printf(_s);\
    } while (0)
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that because we have multiple statements (multiple calls to
\texttt{printf}), we wrap the macro in \texttt{do/while}. This ``loop'' is
one statement long.

\subsection{Why Block Macros?}
\textbf{Give an example of some code where using \texttt{BAD\_DBG\_MACRO}
  would give a different result than \texttt{DBG}}
\begin{lstlisting}
  #include <stdio.h>
  #define BAD_DBG_MACRO(_s)\
    printf("Debug: ");\
    printf(_s);

  int main() {
\end{lstlisting}

\vfill
\texttt{~~~~return 0;\\~~\}}

\emph{\footnotesize Macros Tip: Confused by all of the macros? Try running
  \texttt{gcc~-E~main.c}, which will print the results after expanding all the
  macros (after the preprocessor has run) but before doing anything else.
  Note, this will include the expansion of all \texttt{\#include}'s, so
  there's a lot of stuff at the beginning, but your expanded code will be at
  the bottom.}

\subsection{Adding some context information}

Have you found yourself adding \texttt{printf("here\textbackslash{n}");} and
\texttt{printf("now~here\textbackslash{n}");} to code? Somewhere between
\texttt{"okay~here~now"} and \texttt{"ooh, got here!"}, things can get a bit
confusing\dots While this is probably a sign you should consider using a real
debugger, we can make these debuggging statements a little better. Gcc has
some built-in macros that can be very helpful, such as \texttt{\_\_LINE\_\_}
which expands to the current line:
\begin{lstlisting}
  int main() {
    printf("Currently on line %d\n", __LINE__);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

There are a few others as well that can be useful. Finish this \texttt{DBG}
macro so that it prints the file, function, and line number. The output should
look something like:

\begin{quote}\tt
  Debug main.c::main:18 Program starting
\end{quote}

\bigskip

\begin{lstlisting}
  #include <stdio.h>

  #ifdef NDEBUG
  #define DBG(_s)
  #else
  #define DBG(_s)\




















  #endif

  int main() {
    DBG("Program starting\n");
    printf("Hello World\n");
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Let's Make it Pretty}

Recall that your terminal program a ``terminal emulator''. In early computers,
a terminal simply took in a stream of characters to print and printed those
characters. As terminals got fancier, however, it was sometimes interesting to
send non-printing characters that would change how to terminal behaved. This
was a bit of a mess in the 60s and 70s when every manufacturer had different
``magic characters'' that would change the terminal behavior. Fortunately, we
standardized on a common set of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code}{escape codes} that are
still in use today.

\emph{For this question, you shouldn't need to look anything up, just try
  experimenting with things!}

This version of the \texttt{DBG} macro uses some escape codes. Try it out and
see what it does:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
#define DBG(_s) do {\
  printf("\033[1;31m");\
  printf("Debug: ");\
  printf("\033[0;31m");\
  printf(_s);\
  printf("\033[m");\
  } while (0)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Between lines 2 and 4, the only change is a 1 turns to a 0.
  Looking at the resulting output, what property of the output does this control?}
\vspace{2cm}

\textbf{Check out \texttt{`man ascii`}, what does "033" mean? How can you get
\texttt{`echo`} to print out the '4' character using ascii octal codes? What about the '[' character?}
\vspace{2cm}

\textbf{What can you change line~4 to so that it prints yellow instead?}

\subsection{And let's really make it useful}

The big piece that has been missing so far is that \texttt{printf} is a
\emph{variadic function}, that is it's a function that takes a variable
number of arguments. It would be nice to be able to print variables from our
\texttt{DBG} macro, but to do that we need to set up \texttt{DBG} to take a
variable number of arguments, we need a \texttt{variadic macro}.

\textbf{Write a \texttt{DBG} macro so that this program gives the expected output\\
  \emph{\small(Note, the line numbers do not need to match)}}

\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ make -B main && ./main
cc     main.c   -o main
Debug main.c::main:21	Program name is ./main and was passed 1 argument(s)
Hello World
Debug main.c::main:24	a is 2, a++ is 1, ++a is 2
Modifying variables in debug macros is a bad idea. a is 2
@>@ make -B CFLAGS='-DNDEBUG' main && ./main
cc -DNDEBUG    main.c   -o main
Hello World
Modifying variables in debug macros is a bad idea. a is 0
@>@ cat main.c
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
  #include <stdio.h>
























  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int a = 0;
    int b = 10;

    DBG("Program name is %s and was passed %d argument(s)\n", argv[0], argc);
    printf("Hello World\n");

    DBG("a is %d, a++ is %d, ++a is %d\n", a, a++, ++a);
    printf("Modifying variables in debug macros is a bad idea. a is %d\n", a);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Extending GDB}
While GDB can be very useful, it can sometimes benefit from some assistance
from custom ``pretty printer''s. Consider a simple class such as:

\begin{lstlisting}
  class Point {
  public:
    int x, y;

    Point(int x_coord, int y_coord) {
      x=x_coord; y=y_coord;
    }
  };

  int main() {
    std::vector<Point> points;
    points.push_back(Point( 1,-2));
    points.push_back(Point( 5, 4));
    points.push_back(Point(-8, 2));
    points.push_back(Point( 9,12));
    points.push_back(Point(-1, 2));

    // Break
\end{lstlisting}

While gdb can print \emph{primitive data types}, int's, char's, or other
types built into the language, older versions struggled when asked to print
complex data types such as a vector:

\begin{lstlisting}
  @(gdb)@ print points
  points = {<std::_Vector_base<Point, std::allocator<Point> >> = {
    _M_impl = {<std::allocator<Point>> = {<__gnu_cxx::new_allocator<Point>> = {
      <No data fields>}, <No data fields>}, _M_start = 0x615c90, _M_finish = 0x615cb8,
        _M_end_of_storage = 0x615cd0}}, <No data fields>}
\end{lstlisting}
~

As of gdb 7.0, however, gdb added a pretty printing mechanism that understands
standard library containers, so now we get something more like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  @(gdb)@ print points
  points = std::vector of length 5, capacity 8 = {{x = 1, y = -2}, {x = 5, y = 4},
    {x = -8, y = 2}, {x = 9, y = 12}, {x = -1, y = 2}}
\end{lstlisting}
~

Notice how this both printed information about the vector and then recursively
printed information about its contents. Gdb doesn't really understand
\texttt{Point}s, but it can make an educated guess, which is to print the
public members.

We can help gdb out, however, but teaching it how to print a \texttt{Point}
and what's interesting for us to see:

\begin{lstlisting}
  @(gdb)@ print points
  points = std::vector of length 5, capacity 8 = {(1, -2), (5, 4), (-8, 2), (9, 12), (-1, 2)}
\end{lstlisting}
~

Here's the Python written to make that happen:
\begin{lstlisting}
  import gdb

  class PointPrinter:
      def __init__(self, val):
          self.val = val

      def to_string(self):
          x = self.val['x']   # This is a dictionary lookup in Python
          y = self.val['y']   # You can read any class member variable this way

          # This line creates the string that gdb will use. {}'s are like %d or %s in printf
          return '({}, {})'.format(x,y)

  def lookup_type(val):
      if str(val.type) == 'Point':
          return PointPrinter(val)

  gdb.pretty_printers.append(lookup_type)
\end{lstlisting}
~

In gdb, loading the custom pretty printer is one command:
\begin{lstlisting}
  @(gdb)@ source my_pretty_printer.py
\end{lstlisting}
~

After this line, any time gdb tries to print a \texttt{Point}, it will call
the \texttt{to\_string} function defined here.

\textbf{The Assignment:}

Pick any current or old project with an interesting data type and write a
custom pretty printer for it.

Explain why you chose the elements you did and how they are the most helpful
for debugging. \ul{Do not} simply print the whole structure (like my example
did here). You must explain \ul{why} you chose what you did and why it's the
most useful for debugging.

Include the \ul{declaration} of your class (not the whole definition, aka the
stuff in \texttt{.h}, not \texttt{.c}), your python pretty printer, and a
transcript of a gdb session using your new pretty printer.

There is a lot of information on writing pretty printers available online.
I found
\href{https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Developer_Guide/debuggingprettyprinters.html}
{Red Hat's guide} the easiest to understand, \textbf{but} the last line
\texttt{python execfile} no longer seems to work, use \texttt{source} instead.
You may find other examples more helpful.
