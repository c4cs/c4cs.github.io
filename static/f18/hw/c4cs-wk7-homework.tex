\section{Expressing Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}\small
  \item Run \texttt{make} to build everything.
  \item Run \texttt{make} again (nothing happens).
  \item Edit \texttt{p2.cpp} and make a change (add a comment or something).
  \item Run \texttt{make} again.
  \item Edit \texttt{p2.h} and make a change (add a comment or something).
  \item Run \texttt{make} again.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Why did make rebuild things after step~4 but not after step~6? Why is
this a problem?}
\vspace{2cm}

\textbf{Rewrite the rule for \texttt{simple\_test} so that make rebuilds
correctly for any changes you make:\footnote{You do not need to worry about
  system header files}}
% (Original rule):
%\begin{lstlisting}
%simple_test: simple_test.cpp p2.cpp Recursive_list.cpp Binary_tree.cpp \
%	      recursive.cpp test_helpers.cpp
%	g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -O2 \
%	      simple_test.cpp p2.cpp Recursive_list.cpp Binary_tree.cpp \
%	      recursive.cpp test_helpers.cpp -o simple_test
%\end{lstlisting}

\section{From Build Engine to Rules Engine}

Makefiles are often asked to do more than simply build your software. A common
example is a rule named \texttt{clean} that deletes everything built by the
Makefile.

\begin{enumerate}\small
  \item Run \texttt{make} to build everything.
  \item Run \texttt{make clean} to delete everything that was built.
  \item Run \texttt{make} to build everything.
  \item Run \texttt{touch clean}
  \item Run \texttt{ls} {(\footnotesize do you understand what \texttt{touch} does?)}
  \item Run \texttt{make clean}
\end{enumerate}

Why did make run the \texttt{clean} rule after step~2 but not after step~5?

\textbf{What flag can you pass to make so that it unconditionally ``builds''
  the \texttt{clean} target?}

\texttt{make -\_\_ clean}

\textbf{Describe how to fix the Makefile so that fake targets like \texttt{clean} work correctly.}
\vspace{2cm}

\section{Removing Duplicated Effort}

Notice that currently the \texttt{all} target and the \texttt{test} target
have the same list of dependencies.

\textbf{List all the changes you have to make to the Makefile so that the
  \texttt{test} target correctly depends on the \texttt{all} target in all
  cases.}
\vspace{3cm}

\section{Anything Special about All?}
\label{q:all}

Currently, if you just type \texttt{make}, make will run \texttt{make all}.
One might wonder why make chooses the \texttt{all} goal by default.
While you could look this up, we are computer \emph{scientists}.
Make changes to the Makefile until you are confident that you understand how
make chooses the default goal.

\textbf{Describe the experiments you ran in order to determine what target
  make builds by default.}
\vspace{3cm}

\section{Manipulating \texttt{make}'s environment}

One neat feature of \texttt{make} is that it ships with a large number of
\emph{implicit rules}. \texttt{make} understands that
\texttt{foo.c}$\rightarrow$\texttt{foo.o}$\rightarrow$\texttt{foo} without you
writing any rules. In fact, you can actually run \texttt{make} without a
\texttt{Makefile}! Let's play with this a little.


First let's get a simple environment set up and try some things out:
\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ mkdir /tmp/c4cs-build-systems && cd $_
@>@ echo -e '#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\tprintf("Howdy\\n");\n\treturn 0;\n}\n' > hello.c
@>@ cat hello.c   # just so you can see what that did
@>@ make
@>@ make hello
@>@ ./hello
\end{lstlisting}
Does \texttt{make clean} work? Why not?

Now try
\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ rm hello
@>@ make -r hello
\end{lstlisting}
What does the \texttt{-r} flag do?

Next try
\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ rm hello
@>@ make CFLAGS=-O3 hello
\end{lstlisting}
What changed when hello was built this time?

Finally run
\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ make hello -p | less
\end{lstlisting}

\medskip
\textbf{Make an educated guess at which built-in rule is used to create
  ``hello'' from ``hello.c'' and copy it here. What makes you think this rule
  is responsible?}
%(can you also find where the default goal set from \cref{q:all}?)
\vspace{2.5cm}


Now let's add an additional file to the mix, only a C++ file this time:
\\{(\footnotesize This example uses a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document\#Unix_shells}{special
    shell syntax} for easily writing multiple lines to a shell command)}
\begin{lstlisting}
@>@ cat << MARKER > wazzup.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Wazzup?" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
MARKER
@>@ cat wazzup.cpp
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Using what you have learned, write a single make command (i.e. only
  call make once) that, without a Makefile, will build both ``hello'' and
  ``wazzup'', but builds hello optimized for speed (\texttt{-O3}) and wazzup
  optimized for size (\texttt{-Os}).
  \emph{\small Hint: One is a \texttt{C} program and one is a \texttt{C++} program\dots}
