\section{Understanding your \texttt{PATH}}

In a terminal, type \texttt{PATH=} (just hit enter after the equal sign, no
space characters anywhere). Try to use the terminal like normal (try running
\texttt{ls}). What happened?

\textbf{Give an example of a command that used to work but now doesn't:}
\vspace{1.5cm}

\textbf{Can you still run this command with an empty \texttt{PATH}? How?}
\vspace{1.5cm}

\textbf{Give an example of a command that works the same even with an empty
\texttt{PATH}. Why does this command still work?}
\vspace{1.5cm}


\section{Playing with the shell a bit: Special Variables}

Bash has quite a few special variables that can be very useful when writing
scripts or while working at the terminal.

\textbf{What does the variable \texttt{\$?} do? Give an example where this
value is useful}
\vspace{2cm}

\textbf{What does the variable \texttt{\$1} do? Give an example where this
value is useful}

\section{Basic Scripting}

Recall from lecture that scripting is really just programming, only in a very
high-level language. Interestingly, \texttt{sh} is probably one of the oldest
languages in regular use today.

\texttt{make} is a good tool for build systems, but we can actually use some
basic scripting to accomplish a lot of the same things.
First, write a simple C program that prints ``Hello World!''.
Write a shell script named \texttt{build.sh} that performs the following
actions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compile your program
  \item Runs your program
  \item Verifies that your program outputs exactly the string ``Hello World!''
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There are good utilities that check the \texttt{\ul{diff}}erence of two
        files. They could be helpful.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Prints the string ``All tests passed.'' If the output is correct, or
    prints ``Test failed. Expected output $>>$Hello World$<<$, got
    output $>>$\{the program output\}$<<$''.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Copy the output of \texttt{cat build.sh} here:}

\section{Controlling your environment}

In lecture, we added a directory to our \texttt{PATH} so that we could just
type \texttt{hello} and the Hello World program would run. It would be
annoying to update the \texttt{PATH} variable every time we open a new
terminal. Fortuntately, we can do better.

\textbf{Describe how you would set up your system to modify your \texttt{PATH}
  automatically every time you open a new terminal (what file would you change
  and what would you put in it?)}

\textbf{Roughly how long did you spend on this assignment? \rule{5cm}{0.1mm}}
