less
--
`less` is a tool to view a text file one screen at a time. You can navigate through the file with `j` or `RETURN`, and backwards with `k`

<!-- minimal example -->

~~~ bash
$ less hello.txt
# displays hello.txt
q # to quit
~~~

<!--more-->

### Useful Options / Examples

Typing `/` within `less` allows you to forward search using regex
and `?` allows you to backward search
pressing `n` goes to the next item

~~~ bash
$ less hello.txt
........
........
........
..git...
.....git

:/git
# git will be highlighted
n
# the next git is highlighted
~~~
