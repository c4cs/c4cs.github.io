The `top` command is often used to display the processes that are using the most memory which can be viewed by typing `M`. The processes can also be sorted by CPU usage by typing `P`. A task can be killed using top by pressing `k` and then entering the process id.

### Useful Options / Examples

After running the `top` command:


#### `Q`



Exit the process list and go back to terminal



#### `M`



Sort the process list by memory usage with process using the most memory first



#### `P`



Sort the process list by cpu usage



#### `N`



Sort the process list by process id



#### `T`



Sort the process list by running time



#### `R`



Reverse the sorting order of the currently sorted column. By default, sorting is done in descending order



#### `U`



View only the processes of a specific user


#### `l`


Hide the load average information


#### `m`


Hide the memory information


#### `t`


Hide the task and cpu information

#### `h`
