### Useful Examples

Like any other parameter that refers to elements of a previous command, `$_` can save you alot of typing.
Some common uses are for when you recently created a directory with a long name and want to enter it:

~~~ bash
$ mkdir superLongAndAnnoyingDirectoryName
$ cd $_
$ pwd
/superLongAndAnnoyingDirectoryName
~~~

Another common use is for compiling and running your code:

~~~ bash
$ gcc hello_c4cs.c -o program
$ ./$_
hello C4CS!
~~~
