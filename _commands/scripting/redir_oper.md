\> (standard output redirection operator)

`command1 -[options] [arguments] > <output file name>`

The standard output redirection operator is used in bash to redirect the output of one command to a specified file.

~~~ bash
$ ./a.out > output.txt
~~~

### Useful Options / Examples

#### Combining with `diff`
~~~ bash
$ ./p3 > outfile.txt && diff outfile.txt correct.txt
1c1
< Hello World!
---
> Hello World!!
~~~

##### Break it down

* Sometimes it's helpful to diff a program's output with a different file, as is the case in many EECS projects at UMich. In the above example, the output of 'p3' is redirected to the file `outfile.txt`, and then diff is called to compare the contents of `outfile.txt` to the contents of `correct.txt`. The output that follows the command indicates that the contents of the two files do not match.


#### Splitting stdout and stderr
~~~ bash
$ ./a.out
Hello from cerr!
Hello World!
$ ./a.out > std
Hello from cerr!
~~~


##### Break it down

* In the above example, a.out will print `Hello World!` to standard output, then `Hello from cerr!` to standard error. Since `>` only redirects standard output, the `Hello from cerr!` prints to the terminal normally. This is useful for projects where stdout and sterr messages are interleaved and you want to be able to see each one separately.
