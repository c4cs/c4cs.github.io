Command Webpages
================

If you'd like to work on a the documentation for a command, first check if
there's an [open issue](https://github.com/c4cs/c4cs.github.io/issues) so that
you don't conflict with someone else's efforts.

If there's not an issue for what you want to work on, first open a new issue so
that others know you're working on it, then fix it! Please note that your command's
`.md` file must be placed in one of the existing subfolders (`basics`, `editors`, etc.)
and it cannot share the same name as a file in another subfolder. If you would like
to use local images in your documentation, the image files should be placed in a
separate image folder at [`../static/commands/img`](../static/commands/img), they
will not render on the site properly if they're put in the same folder as the `.md`
file.
