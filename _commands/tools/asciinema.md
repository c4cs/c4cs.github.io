asciinema

`asciinema` is a tool that allows you to record a terminal session with out having to use screen capture. It also allows for easy copy-pasting!
<!-- one line explanation would go here -->

<!-- minimal example -->
~~~ bash
$ sudo apt-get install asciinema #install
$ asciinema rec #start session
$ your_commands_here
$ exit #exit session
~~~

<!--more-->

### Things To Note:

* `asciinema` is not an installed package - run the first command from the example to get started

* It also only has two functionalities: start recording and stop recording.

* `asciinema rec` starts the recording as soon as you start typing the next command

* `exit` immediately stops the recording and prompts you to `~Press <Enter> to upload` and then provides you with a unique link to your session!
