SUBJECT: [C4CS] Advanced Homework Reminder
FROM: c4cs-staff@umich.edu

Hi {{uniq}},

This is a friendly reminder that advanced homework is 30% of your grade
in EECS 398. At this time, we have {{num_complete}} exercise(s) recorded for you.
Please reply immediately if you believe there to be an error.

Including this section, there are two sections of the course remaining. This
means if you have not completed any advanced homework you will need to complete
four in order to earn full points for advanced homework. Please review the
assignment and grading policy on the course website for the full information:

Cheers,
- C4CS staff
